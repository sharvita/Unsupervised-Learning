    "For this lab, we will also need some new dependencies. Follow the steps below to install the new dependencies to your `tf` conda environment.\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is the process of learning about the structure and relationships between samples in a dataset without the use of any ground truth labels. Unlike supervised learning models which require knowledge of the class structure of the data, unsupervised learning models are capable of learning directly from the data itself, without any class labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common methods for unsupervised learning is called \"clustering\". Clustering is the process of parititoning a dataset into groups. Samples within each group or \"cluster\" are similar to each other in some respect. In a typical \"hard\" clustering, each sample belongs to a single cluster (i.e. Samples can not belong to more than one cluster). However, there are \"soft\" clustering algorithms which can allow for samples to belong to multiple clusters at once."

    "\n",
    "The $k$-means algorithm is a popular and relatively simple algorithm for clustering. To initialize the algorithm, the user must first specify $k$ which represents the number of clusters to be generated. Once $k$ is chosen, the algorithm will intialize $k$ centroids, which will represent the centers of the $k$ clusters. \n",
    "\n",
    "### $k$-means algorithm:\n",
    "1. For each sample, calculate the distance between that sample and **each** of the $k$ centroids.\n",
    "2. Assign each of the samples the \"label\" of the *nearest* centroid.\n",
    "3. Update each of the $k$ centroids by setting it equal to the the **mean** of the samples which have that centroid's label. \n",
    "\n",
    "This process is performed iteratively until some stopping criteria is met. \n",

    "## Determining the Best $k$:\n",
    "The $k$-means algorithm requires that the user choose $k$, the number of cluster centroids. However, this causes a chicken-and-egg problem! If we are trying to perform *unsupervised* learning we **don't know** how many clusters we should use in the first place! We can try clustering with multiple values for $k$, but we need a way to pick the best $k$ out of the candidates that we try.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to find the $k$ that most agrees with the data, we will use a metric known as Silhouette Score.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Silhouette Score\n",
    "Silhouette Score is a metric that may be used to measure how well a set of cluster labels \"agree\" with the distribution of the data.\n",

    "$$ s(i) = \\frac{b(i) - a(i)}{\\max{\\{a(i),b(i)\\}}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first equation $a(i)$ calculates the average distance from sample $i$ to all other points within the same cluster as $i$.\n",
    "* The second equation $b(i)$ calculates the average distance from sample $i$ to the points in the second-closest cluster to $i$. \n",
    "* The third equation $s(i)$ combines $a(i)$ and $b(i)$ into a single metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, $a(i)$ measures how close sample $i$ is to the other points in the same cluster. Low values for $i$ indicate that the $i$ is very close to the other points in the cluster, indicating that the cluster is dense.\n",
    "\n",
    "$b(i)$ measures the distance between $i$'s \"home\" cluster and the second-closest cluster to $i$. If this value is large, than $i$ is well-clustered, since it is much closer to points within its own cluster than to points in the second closest cluster. \n",
    "\n",
    "$s(i)$ arranges $a(i)$ and $b(i)$ into a normalized term in the interval $[-1,1]$. A value of $s(i) \\approx 1$, indicates a \"good\" clustering for $i$, since $s(i)$ will be close to one when:\n",

    "* $b(i)$ is large ($i$ is well-separated from the neighboring cluster). \n",
